# Clipboard Inserter Plus Plus

Clipboard inserter that autoscrolls to the bottom and has a decent built in theme

## Usage

Download the extension and click on the icon to start grabbing text!

## Building

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) via

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install dependencies
```
pnpm install
```

Build!
```
pnpm build
```

## Longer Description

When activated, this extension opens a new page and listens to clipboard changes, displaying them in a tab. The page itself has some nice features like autoscroll and styling, with more to come in the future!

## Not Good

Turns out Yomichan, or all extensions for that matter, can't access pages generated created by other extensions. RIP. Also, Yomichan has a built in clipboard inserter too. RIP. F.
