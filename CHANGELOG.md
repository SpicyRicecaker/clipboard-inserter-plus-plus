- [x] Implement an options menu
- [x] Add option to add text at the top instead of at the bottom so no scrolling is needed
- [x] Need to add someway to persist storage of the option as well (as it'd be annoying to toggle between it)
- [x] When sorting from top to bottom, move the options bar to the bottom as well, such that scroll snapping works smoothly both ways

- [ ] ...And if we're persisting the storage, we might as well add an option to persist clipboard history as well
